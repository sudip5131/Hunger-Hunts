"# hungerHunt" 

This project had been completed in order to meet the requirements of the course COMP 311 offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kathmandu University. Our project was an android based application built to an online food ordering system that enables ease for the customers. It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional queuing system. Our proposed system was a medium to order online food hassle free from restaurants. This application improves the method of taking the order from customer. Hunger-Hunt sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place the order as per their wish. Also with a food menu, customers can easily track the orders. Hunger-Hunt also provides a feedback system in which user can rate the food items. Also, the proposed system can recommend hotels, food, based on the ratings given by the user, the hotel staff will be informed for the improvements along with the quality. The payment is pay-on-delivery system. For more secured ordering separate accounts are maintained for each user by providing them an ID and a password.
